# Getting Started

Battle Royale-style video games have taken the world by storm. 100 players are dropped onto an island empty-handed and must explore, 
scavenge, and eliminate other players until only one is left standing, all while the play zone continues to shrink.

It's a kaggle competition where we have to predict the final "Finish Placement Prediction" of all the players who participated in the Game.
This repo  aimed at intermediate machine learning engineers,
DevOps, technology architects and programmers who are interested in knowing more about How to practically use machine learning,
especially in the relm of big data set. After gaining most out of this repo, 
you have a descent understanding of how to scale-out machine learning algorithms in general and how to use them.


Tools and frameworks like, scikit learn,google colab , and AWS(amazon web services)  are used to showcase the strengths of various approaches, 
trade-offs and building blocks for creating real-world examples of distributed ML models.

# Prerequisites

![Prerequisites](https://media2.giphy.com/media/RV9yRyaeBJnFe/source.gif)

This pubg repo  is for beginners & intermediate machine learners like you who want to learn more about ML, 
how to scale out your ML model, and then quickly turn around and use the tools and techniques you are about to learn from this course to solve your tricky Machine Learing tasks.

You will be successfully is project  if you have a basic knowledge of computer programming especially Python programming language. 
Also some familiarity with Machine Learning like ML Algorithm and their  will be helpful.

In this course, you will need a AWS free tier account. Note that you won't be charged by creating the account.
Particularly in aws we gonna work on amazon sagemaker notebook very similar to jupyter notebook.

## Usage
Run this using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). 
Just type `colab.research.google` in a browser window and set up you google first google colab notebook.To setup your first google colab
notebook, gmail account is must.

Starting guide for Colab beginners : [GET STARTED WITH GOOGLE COLAB # FREE GPU](http://ai-venture.com/get-started-with-google-colab-free-gpu/). 

## Result
The output of the code is to predict the  "Final Finish Placement Prediction" of all the playes who participated in the Game.
